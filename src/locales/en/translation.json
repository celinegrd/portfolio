        "title": "My Story",
        "intro": "I‚Äôve always had two big passions: cooking and video games.",
        "origin": "Originally, it was my dream to one day create my own video game that led me to code. But as I explored this universe, I discovered web development‚Ä¶ and found not just a springboard, but a true passion.",
        "experience": "For a long time, I thought working in the video game industry was an unreachable dream, so I chose to thrive in the restaurant world. For 8 years, I learned much more than just recipes: autonomy, organization, stock management, communication, leadership, customer relations‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been a waitress, cook, bartender, ma√Ætre d', barista, and finally head chef in a caf√©.",
        "sharing": "What I‚Äôve learned above all is <strong>the importance of sharing</strong>. Sharing skills, experiences (<em>and even mistakes</em>) to move forward together. Personal development is a compass that guides me: learning, listening, self-reflection, evolving.",
        "reconversion": "After 8 years in the restaurant industry, I took a courage potion and decided to retrain in web and mobile development. I started by exploring this new universe on my own for a year, then completed my training as an Application Designer & Developer at ALT in 2025.",
        "creativity": "Creative at heart, I love expressing myself through cooking, drawing, writing, photography, video editing‚Ä¶ and also through code!",
        "logic": "And what I love most of all: logic, numbers, and puzzles to solve. Every bug is a challenge to overcome, like a mini-investigation to resolve.",
        "conclusion": "This mix of creativity and logical thinking made me realize I had found my path.",
        "closing": "Today, I‚Äôm ready to join a team as a full-stack web developer, with solid skills, a strong desire to grow, and always that will to share, learn, and build connections.",
